Ethical Barcode
==================
Ethical Barcode was a non-profit project to educates consumers about the products they buy and the companies who make them.
It was built to enlighten customers about the brands they buy and the practices they are supporting as a result.

The goal was to help customers make informed purchases in an attempt to inspire companies to share our values and passions.
